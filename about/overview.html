         <p>
           I'm currently a student at Ada Developers Academy, an intensive full-stack programming school for women. Having recently finished my PhD in Neuroscience, I often get asked why I spent all that time and energy just to immediately go back to school to become a software developer. Although it might seem like a drastic change from the outside, for me, the process has been so fluid that I've hardly felt like I made a decision to switch careers.
         </p>
         <p>
            My research focused on how the brain organizes and computes information, and the obvious parallels between neural computing and machine computing have made it feel like second nature to think about the structure and dynamic interactions of software systems. As a scientist, I particularly enjoyed the constant need to implement and adapt unfamiliar technologies for experiments, and, throughout graduate school, my problem solving solutions gradually erred towards programming more and more. By the end, I realized that a scientifically literate software developer could be incredibly useful a world where scientific information is getting ever more complex.
         </p>
         <p>
            As a newcomer to this world, I'm first and foremost devoted to learning as much as I can about all aspects of software development, but I'm particularly interested in interactive data visualization. In the long run, I hope to make tools that will enable scientists to create, explore, and share scientific information more readily.
